Q1- 	I changed the draw_Everything subroutine.
      To modify each color I just changed the values of the colors to make new colors.
      
Q2-  I modified process_input by changed the K_UP, K_DOWN, K_LEFT, and K_RIGHT keys 
     to K_w, K_s, K_a, and K_d. I also had to import the new keys.
    
Q3-  A: I modified process_input by changing the 'direction = (0,1)' and changing the 1 values to 2 to double the speed.
     B: It's a good idea because it seperates calls to pygame from the main game loop
    
Q4-  I changed the create_borders subroutine by creating two new boarders inside of it that act as the barriers.
     pygame.Rect(50,50,2,50)
     pygame.Rect(300,150,2,75)
      
Q5-  Im process_input I added a new key event for K_SPACE and changed the speed of direction to (0,0) to stop the box whenever the boolean
     'paused' is false, if it is true then speed is restored and the game continues. I also had to add in 'paused' to the 
     parameters for process_event and also return the value of pause(True/false).
